    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
  <p>
    Hi! My name is Andrea Alfonzo, and I’m currently an uprising junior in high school. I created Engineering Pathways to help students — like you — navigate the journey to becoming an engineer with clarity, confidence, and creativity.
  </p>

  <h3>Why I Chose Engineering</h3>
  <p>
    My love for how things work started early. I still remember the moment I discovered that pens have tiny coils inside — that discovery sparked what I now call my “inventor phase.” While I later let go of the idea of becoming an inventor, I found something even more exciting: engineering. It gave me a real path to create things that make life easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve always loved problem-solving, especially in math. There’s something satisfying about recognizing patterns — like a difference of squares — and applying them to find elegant and creative solutions. When I learned about Python in high school, I started imagining solutions to everyday problems from my childhood. I sketched ideas for a finger-controlled light switch and dreamed of building a smart system that would turn off my lights without leaving bed. Those ideas didn’t just stay ideas — they evolved into a real curiosity about engineering.
  </p>

  <h3>Why I Built This Website</h3>
  <p>
    During my freshman year, my dad encouraged me to explore future careers. That’s when it all clicked. Engineering wasn’t just a subject — it was the bridge between childhood imagination and real-world innovation.
  </p>
  <p>
    But as I started researching, I realized how overwhelming the process was. I didn’t know which classes to take, how to prepare for the SAT, or what opportunities existed outside the classroom — especially as someone who didn’t live in a place with tons of accessible programs. I felt like I had so many ideas, but no roadmap to follow.
  </p>
  <p>
    What helped me move forward was the idea that there’s no risk in trying — advice from my older brother, who was also starting his own engineering journey. I started researching like crazy: I watched interviews, read articles, planned out my courses, and tackled the SAT one problem at a time. At the gym, I shared my study plan with a friend, and she found it so helpful that I realized something: if I could help one person feel more confident, I could help so many more.
  </p>

  <h3>What You’ll Find Here</h3>
  <p>
    Engineering Pathways is a collection of everything I’ve learned since freshman year. It includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Class recommendations by grade level</li>
    <li>SAT & AP prep resources</li>
    <li>Project, internship, and extracurricular ideas</li>
    <li>Scholarship and university tools</li>
    <li>Articles and interviews to inspire and inform</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    And although this site is focused on engineering, it’s built to help anyone who wants to challenge themselves and grow — even if they aren’t pursuing engineering.
  </p>

  <h3>My Mission</h3>
  <p>
    My goal is to make engineering feel accessible, exciting, and achievable. I want students everywhere — no matter their background or school — to know that they can do this. That their ideas matter. That it’s okay to start small, explore slowly, and find your way at your own pace.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is just the beginning. In the future, I hope to expand the site with a tutoring section, a community submission portal for advice and opportunities, and a stronger Instagram presence to feature weekly interviews with students and engineers around the world.
  </p>

  <h3>A Final Note</h3>
  <p>
    I hope this site helps you find your footing and your spark.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you so much for being here. This site means a lot to me, and I hope it becomes a place that means something to you, too.
