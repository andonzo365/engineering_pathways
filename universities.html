    <h3>University Ranking & Research Websites</h3>
    <p>Rankings are a helpful starting point, but they should never be the only factor in your decision.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/engineering-doctorate" target="_blank">U.S. News – Engineering Rankings</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/engineering-technology" target="_blank">QS World Rankings – Engineering & Technology</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges-for-engineering/" target="_blank">Niche – Engineering Colleges</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/" target="_blank">College Navigator (Official Data)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.commonapp.org/explore/colleges" target="_blank">Common App College Search</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Evaluate Engineering Programs Beyond Rankings</h3>
    <p>Two schools with similar rankings can offer very different experiences.</p>
    
   <h3>1. Accreditation</h3>
  <p>
    Make sure the engineering program is <strong>ABET-accredited</strong>.
    Accreditation ensures the curriculum meets industry and professional standards.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Most U.S. public and private engineering schools are ABET-accredited</li>
    <li>Always check the specific major, not just the university</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Engineering Specializations</h3>
  <p>
    Not all schools offer every engineering discipline.
    Some universities are especially strong in certain fields.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Chemical & Materials Engineering</li>
    <li>Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering</li>
    <li>Electrical & Computer Engineering</li>
    <li>Civil & Environmental Engineering</li>
    <li>Industrial, Systems, or Design Engineering</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Hands-On Learning & Research</h3>
  <p>
    Engineering education is strongest when theory is paired with practice.
    Look for schools that emphasize labs, projects, and undergraduate research.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First-year design or engineering foundations courses</li>
    <li>Undergraduate research opportunities</li>
    <li>Senior capstone projects with real-world applications</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Internships, Co-ops, and Industry Connections</h3>
  <p>
    Strong engineering schools maintain close relationships with industry partners.
    These connections can significantly improve job placement after graduation.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Formal co-op programs</li>
    <li>Career fairs specifically for engineering students</li>
    <li>High internship and job placement rates</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Class Size & Learning Environment</h3>
  <p>
    Learning style matters. Some students thrive in large lecture-based environments,
    while others prefer smaller, discussion-based classes.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Large public universities often offer extensive resources and research</li>
    <li>Smaller schools may provide closer faculty interaction</li>
    <li>Look into student-to-faculty ratios for engineering departments</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6. Cost, Scholarships, and Financial Fit</h3>
  <p>
    Engineering degrees are an investment.
    Consider both cost and return on investment when choosing a school.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In-state vs. out-of-state tuition</li>
    <li>Merit scholarships for STEM students</li>
    <li>Graduation rates and average starting salaries</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7. Examples of Strong Engineering Universities</h3>
  <p>
    These schools are known for strong undergraduate engineering programs.
    This is not an exhaustive list, nor a ranking.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Public Universities:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Georgia Institute of Technology</li>
    <li>University of Michigan</li>
    <li>Texas A&M University</li>
    <li>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</li>
    <li>Purdue University</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Private Universities:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</li>
    <li>Stanford University</li>
    <li>Carnegie Mellon University</li>
    <li>Caltech</li>
    <li>Cornell University</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>8. Questions to Ask Before Applying</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What research or design opportunities are available to freshmen?</li>
    <li>How easy is it to switch engineering majors?</li>
    <li>What support exists for internships and career placement?</li>
    <li>How competitive are engineering courses?</li>
 

    <h3>What Engineering Schools Look for in Applicants</h3>
    <p>Once you have a list of potential universities, research what they expect from admitted engineering freshmen.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Course Rigor:</strong> Calculus, physics, chemistry, and advanced math</li>
      <li><strong>AP/IB Classes:</strong> Especially AP Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, and CS</li>
      <li><strong>SAT/ACT Scores:</strong> Look at middle 50% ranges, not just averages</li>
      <li><strong>Grades in STEM:</strong> Strong performance in math and science matters most</li>
      <li><strong>Fit:</strong> Motivation, curiosity, and problem-solving mindset</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Using University Websites Effectively</h3>
    <p>Most of the information you need is already on a school’s website — you just need to know where to look.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search for <em>“First-Year Profile”</em> or <em>“Class of 202X”</em></li>
      <li>Check both the <strong>Admissions</strong> page and the <strong>College of Engineering</strong> page</li>
      <li>Look for recommended high school coursework</li>
      <li>Review AP credit and placement policies</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Building a Balanced College List</h3>
    <p>Engineering admissions are often more competitive than general admissions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Strong chance of admission with engineering major</li>
      <li><strong>Match:</strong> Your stats align well with admitted students</li>
      <li><strong>Reach:</strong> Competitive but possible</li>
      <li>Aim for balance — not all reaches</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Templates & Planning Tools</h3>
    <p>Staying organized makes the application process far less stressful.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>University comparison spreadsheet (rankings, location, cost)</li>
      <li>Engineering requirements tracker (math, physics, APs)</li>
      <li>Application deadline checklist</li>
      <li>Notes section: “Why I like this school”</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Templates coming soon (Google Sheets / Notion).</em></p>

    <h3>Final Advice</h3>
    <p>There is no single “best” engineering school — only the best fit for <strong>you</strong>.</p>
    <p>Focus on growth, opportunity, and environment. A well-matched school can open just as many doors as a top-ranked one.</p>
