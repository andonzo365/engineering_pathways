    <h3>University Ranking & Research Websites</h3>
    <p>Rankings are a helpful starting point, but they should never be the only factor in your decision.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/engineering-doctorate" target="_blank">U.S. News – Engineering Rankings</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/engineering-technology" target="_blank">QS World Rankings – Engineering & Technology</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges-for-engineering/" target="_blank">Niche – Engineering Colleges</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/" target="_blank">College Navigator (Official Data)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.commonapp.org/explore/colleges" target="_blank">Common App College Search</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Evaluate Engineering Programs Beyond Rankings</h3>
    <p>Two schools with similar rankings can offer very different experiences.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ABET Accreditation:</strong> Confirms program quality and professional standards</li>
      <li><strong>Major Strength:</strong> Some schools specialize in certain engineering fields</li>
      <li><strong>Hands-On Learning:</strong> Design projects, labs, and maker spaces</li>
      <li><strong>Research Opportunities:</strong> Access for undergraduates matters</li>
      <li><strong>Industry Connections:</strong> Internships, co-ops, and job placement</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Engineering Schools Look for in Applicants</h3>
    <p>Once you have a list of potential universities, research what they expect from admitted engineering freshmen.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Course Rigor:</strong> Calculus, physics, chemistry, and advanced math</li>
      <li><strong>AP/IB Classes:</strong> Especially AP Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, and CS</li>
      <li><strong>SAT/ACT Scores:</strong> Look at middle 50% ranges, not just averages</li>
      <li><strong>Grades in STEM:</strong> Strong performance in math and science matters most</li>
      <li><strong>Fit:</strong> Motivation, curiosity, and problem-solving mindset</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Using University Websites Effectively</h3>
    <p>Most of the information you need is already on a school’s website — you just need to know where to look.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search for <em>“First-Year Profile”</em> or <em>“Class of 202X”</em></li>
      <li>Check both the <strong>Admissions</strong> page and the <strong>College of Engineering</strong> page</li>
      <li>Look for recommended high school coursework</li>
      <li>Review AP credit and placement policies</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Building a Balanced College List</h3>
    <p>Engineering admissions are often more competitive than general admissions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Strong chance of admission with engineering major</li>
      <li><strong>Match:</strong> Your stats align well with admitted students</li>
      <li><strong>Reach:</strong> Competitive but possible</li>
      <li>Aim for balance — not all reaches</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Templates & Planning Tools</h3>
    <p>Staying organized makes the application process far less stressful.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>University comparison spreadsheet (rankings, location, cost)</li>
      <li>Engineering requirements tracker (math, physics, APs)</li>
      <li>Application deadline checklist</li>
      <li>Notes section: “Why I like this school”</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Templates coming soon (Google Sheets / Notion).</em></p>

    <h3>Final Advice</h3>
    <p>There is no single “best” engineering school — only the best fit for <strong>you</strong>.</p>
    <p>Focus on growth, opportunity, and environment. A well-matched school can open just as many doors as a top-ranked one.</p>
