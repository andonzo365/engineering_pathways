  <h2>Choosing the Right Engineering University</h2>
  <p>How to evaluate engineering programs beyond rankings.</p>
</section>

<section class="content" style="max-width: 900px; margin: auto; padding: 2rem; line-height: 1.6;">

  <h3>What Actually Matters for Engineering</h3>
  <p>
    Choosing an engineering school is not just about prestige.
    The best program for you is one that offers strong academics, hands-on experience,
    and support for your long-term goals.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Accreditation</h3>
  <p>
    Make sure the engineering program is <strong>ABET-accredited</strong>.
    Accreditation ensures the curriculum meets industry and professional standards.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Most U.S. public and private engineering schools are ABET-accredited</li>
    <li>Always check the specific major, not just the university</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Engineering Specializations</h3>
  <p>
    Not all schools offer every engineering discipline.
    Some universities are especially strong in certain fields.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Chemical & Materials Engineering</li>
    <li>Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering</li>
    <li>Electrical & Computer Engineering</li>
    <li>Civil & Environmental Engineering</li>
    <li>Industrial, Systems, or Design Engineering</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Hands-On Learning & Research</h3>
  <p>
    Engineering education is strongest when theory is paired with practice.
    Look for schools that emphasize labs, projects, and undergraduate research.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First-year design or engineering foundations courses</li>
    <li>Undergraduate research opportunities</li>
    <li>Senior capstone projects with real-world applications</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Internships, Co-ops, and Industry Connections</h3>
  <p>
    Strong engineering schools maintain close relationships with industry partners.
    These connections can significantly improve job placement after graduation.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Formal co-op programs</li>
    <li>Career fairs specifically for engineering students</li>
    <li>High internship and job placement rates</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Class Size & Learning Environment</h3>
  <p>
    Learning style matters. Some students thrive in large lecture-based environments,
    while others prefer smaller, discussion-based classes.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Large public universities often offer extensive resources and research</li>
    <li>Smaller schools may provide closer faculty interaction</li>
    <li>Look into student-to-faculty ratios for engineering departments</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6. Cost, Scholarships, and Financial Fit</h3>
  <p>
    Engineering degrees are an investment.
    Consider both cost and return on investment when choosing a school.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In-state vs. out-of-state tuition</li>
    <li>Merit scholarships for STEM students</li>
    <li>Graduation rates and average starting salaries</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7. Examples of Strong Engineering Universities</h3>
  <p>
    These schools are known for strong undergraduate engineering programs.
    This is not an exhaustive list, nor a ranking.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Public Universities:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Georgia Institute of Technology</li>
    <li>University of Michigan</li>
    <li>Texas A&M University</li>
    <li>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</li>
    <li>Purdue University</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Private Universities:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</li>
    <li>Stanford University</li>
    <li>Carnegie Mellon University</li>
    <li>Caltech</li>
    <li>Cornell University</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>8. Questions to Ask Before Applying</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What research or design opportunities are available to freshmen?</li>
    <li>How easy is it to switch engineering majors?</li>
    <li>What support exists for internships and career placement?</li>
    <li>How competitive are engineering courses?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
  <p>
    The best engineering school is one where you will grow academically,
    gain real-world experience, and feel supported.
    Focus on fit, not just rankings.
